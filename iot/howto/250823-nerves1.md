# How to use nerves iot and phoenix for virtual power plant

To build a virtual power plant (VPP) with Nerves and Phoenix, you'll create a "poncho project" with a Nerves firmware app for device-level control and a separate Phoenix UI app for a web interface, connecting them through a monorepo structure. 

On the device side, Nerves handles networking, I/O, and firmware updates for your distributed energy assets, while the Phoenix app, particularly with LiveView, provides real-time monitoring and control via a browser-based dashboard. 

The central VPP platform, built with Phoenix, aggregates data from Nerves devices to optimize asset performance and achieve grid-level benefits.
 
1. Set up the Project Structure: 
Create a Monorepo: Use the Nerves generator to create a new Nerves project and then add a Phoenix project as a dependency within the same repository.
```Code

    mix nerves.new my_vpp_firmware
    cd my_vpp_firmware
    # Add the Phoenix UI project as a dependency in mix.exs
```
Create the Phoenix UI: Generate a Phoenix project, ensuring to include the --live flag for Phoenix LiveView, which is crucial for real-time interaction on your web interface. 

2. Develop the Nerves Firmware:
Device-Specific Configuration:
Configure your Nerves project for the specific hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi) and set up WiFi for device connectivity.

Handle Hardware Interaction:
Use the Nerves ecosystem to access I/O, monitor sensors (like temperature, wind speed), and control inverters and batteries on your distributed energy assets. 

3. Build the Phoenix-based VPP Control Platform:
Real-time Interface:
The Phoenix application, especially with LiveView, will serve as the central control system. 
Data Aggregation:
Develop logic to receive and aggregate data from multiple Nerves-powered IoT devices. 
Optimization & Control:
Implement algorithms (potentially with AI/ML) to analyze the data and send control commands back to the devices, coordinating them to act as a single VPP. 
4. Connect the Components:
Device to Cloud:
Nerves manages secure data transmission from the edge devices to the central Phoenix application. 
Web Interface:
The Phoenix LiveView interface displays the real-time status of all connected assets and allows for manual or automated control commands. 

## Key Considerations for a VPP:
Security:
Implement robust security protocols, including encryption and authentication, for data transmission between devices and the central platform. 

Scalability:
Design the architecture to handle a large number of distributed energy resources, ensuring the central control system can scale efficiently. 

Data Management:
Establish a strategy for storing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of real-time data from the VPP. 

AI/ML Integration:
For advanced VPPs, integrate machine learning for accurate energy forecasting and optimization of asset performance. 

## Poncho Projects (Elixir Software Development)
Source: embedded-elixir.com [Hunleth blog](https://embedded-elixir.com/)

Description: In the Elixir programming language, a "poncho project" is a software architecture that uses separate, 
but related, applications to handle specific functionalities, rather than a single, large "umbrella" application. 

It offers benefits like independent development, clearer configurations, and reduced coupling, 
providing a protective "poncho" that prevents code from leaking between distinct parts of a system.

Nerves IoT and Phoenix for VPP refers to using the Nerves platform to build robust embedded systems for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the Phoenix web framework to provide user interfaces and manage device interactions, often via Phoenix LiveView for live, interactive web UIs. 

Nerves simplifies building and deploying Elixir applications on hardware by managing infrastructure like the operating system, 
networking, and firmware updates, while Phoenix provides a full-stack framework for device-based web applications. 

The combination enables developers to create full-stack IoT solutions, from the device to a user-friendly web interface, with the reliability and fault tolerance of Elixir. 

How Nerves and Phoenix work together for IoT projects

1. Nerves for Embedded Systems:

Builds the "Firmware": Nerves uses Elixir and Erlang to build lightweight Linux-based firmware for embedded devices like the Raspberry Pi. 

Simplifies Deployment: It handles infrastructure concerns like networking, device discovery, I/O, and secure over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates. 

Ensures Reliability: The Erlang runtime's fault-tolerance and supervision trees allow for resilient systems, 
while the dual firmware slots facilitate reliable OTA updates. 

2. Phoenix for the "VPP" (or Device UI/Backend):

Serves Content from the Device: The Phoenix Framework can run directly on the Nerves device to serve content over HTTP, providing a web interface. 

Enables Interactive UIs: Phoenix LiveView allows developers to build real-time, interactive user interfaces that update directly from the device without requiring separate JavaScript. 

Full-Stack Development: This allows you to build a complete IoT solution where the device acts 
as both the embedded hardware and the backend/frontend server for managing it.

### Practical Applications

Smart Devices:

Create smart weather stations or other connected devices that can be monitored and controlled via a web browser. 

Device Management:

Develop a full-stack solution where the Nerves device runs a Phoenix backend to manage its functions and provide a web-based control panel. 

Data Visualization:

Use Phoenix to create dashboards that display real-time data collected by the Nerves device.

# nerves iot app running on raspberry pi sample

Nerves is an embedded Elixir platform for building IoT applications on devices like the Raspberry Pi. 
To create a sample Nerves IoT application running on a Raspberry Pi, one can follow these general steps:

Set up the Nerves development environment:

Install Elixir and Erlang.
Install nerves_bootstrap using mix archive.install hex nerves_bootstrap.

Create a new Nerves project:

Use `mix nerves.new my_iot_app` to create a new project directory.

Navigate into the new project directory: `cd my_iot_app`.

Configure the target hardware:

Set the MIX_TARGET environment variable to match your Raspberry Pi model (e.g., export MIX_TARGET=rpi3 for a Raspberry Pi 3). 
This tells Nerves which system image to build.

Add dependencies and application logic:

Edit the mix.exs file to add necessary dependencies, such as circuits_gpio for GPIO control if you're interacting with hardware.

Implement your application logic in Elixir modules within the lib directory. For example, 
a simple "Blinky" application might use Circuits.GPIO to toggle an LED connected to a specific GPIO pin.

Build the firmware:
Run mix firmware to compile your application and build the Nerves firmware image for your specified target.

Burn the firmware to an SD card:

Use mix firmware.burn to write the generated firmware image to an SD card. This command will prompt you to select the correct SD card device.

Boot the Raspberry Pi:
Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and power it on. The Nerves application should boot and run.

Example (Blinky application):

A common starting point is the "Blinky" example, which demonstrates basic hardware interaction. This involves:

Adding {:circuits_gpio, "~> 2.0"} to your deps in mix.exs.

Creating a GenServer or simple module to manage the LED state, using Circuits.GPIO.open/1 and Circuits.GPIO.write/2 to control the LED.

Starting this module in your application's supervision tree (in `lib/my_iot_app/application.ex`).

Interacting with the running application:
After booting, you can connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH and access an interactive Elixir shell (IEx) 
to inspect and interact with your running Nerves application.
