# nerves iot and phoenix for virtual power plant

Nerves IoT and Phoenix for VPP refers to using the Nerves platform to build robust embedded systems for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the Phoenix web framework to provide user interfaces and manage device interactions, often via Phoenix LiveView for live, interactive web UIs. 

Nerves simplifies building and deploying Elixir applications on hardware by managing infrastructure like the operating system, 
networking, and firmware updates, while Phoenix provides a full-stack framework for device-based web applications. 

The combination enables developers to create full-stack IoT solutions, from the device to a user-friendly web interface, with the reliability and fault tolerance of Elixir. 

How Nerves and Phoenix work together for IoT projects

1. Nerves for Embedded Systems:

Builds the "Firmware": Nerves uses Elixir and Erlang to build lightweight Linux-based firmware for embedded devices like the Raspberry Pi. 

Simplifies Deployment: It handles infrastructure concerns like networking, device discovery, I/O, and secure over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates. 

Ensures Reliability: The Erlang runtime's fault-tolerance and supervision trees allow for resilient systems, 
while the dual firmware slots facilitate reliable OTA updates. 

2. Phoenix for the "VPP" (or Device UI/Backend):

Serves Content from the Device: The Phoenix Framework can run directly on the Nerves device to serve content over HTTP, providing a web interface. 

Enables Interactive UIs: Phoenix LiveView allows developers to build real-time, interactive user interfaces that update directly from the device without requiring separate JavaScript. 

Full-Stack Development: This allows you to build a complete IoT solution where the device acts 
as both the embedded hardware and the backend/frontend server for managing it.

### Practical Applications

Smart Devices:

Create smart weather stations or other connected devices that can be monitored and controlled via a web browser. 

Device Management:

Develop a full-stack solution where the Nerves device runs a Phoenix backend to manage its functions and provide a web-based control panel. 

Data Visualization:

Use Phoenix to create dashboards that display real-time data collected by the Nerves device. 


# nerves iot app running on raspberry pi sample

Nerves is an embedded Elixir platform for building IoT applications on devices like the Raspberry Pi. 
To create a sample Nerves IoT application running on a Raspberry Pi, one can follow these general steps:

Set up the Nerves development environment:

Install Elixir and Erlang.
Install nerves_bootstrap using mix archive.install hex nerves_bootstrap.

Create a new Nerves project:

Use `mix nerves.new my_iot_app` to create a new project directory.

Navigate into the new project directory: `cd my_iot_app`.

Configure the target hardware:

Set the MIX_TARGET environment variable to match your Raspberry Pi model (e.g., export MIX_TARGET=rpi3 for a Raspberry Pi 3). 
This tells Nerves which system image to build.

Add dependencies and application logic:

Edit the mix.exs file to add necessary dependencies, such as circuits_gpio for GPIO control if you're interacting with hardware.

Implement your application logic in Elixir modules within the lib directory. For example, 
a simple "Blinky" application might use Circuits.GPIO to toggle an LED connected to a specific GPIO pin.

Build the firmware:
Run mix firmware to compile your application and build the Nerves firmware image for your specified target.

Burn the firmware to an SD card:

Use mix firmware.burn to write the generated firmware image to an SD card. This command will prompt you to select the correct SD card device.

Boot the Raspberry Pi:
Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and power it on. The Nerves application should boot and run.

Example (Blinky application):

A common starting point is the "Blinky" example, which demonstrates basic hardware interaction. This involves:

Adding {:circuits_gpio, "~> 2.0"} to your deps in mix.exs.

Creating a GenServer or simple module to manage the LED state, using Circuits.GPIO.open/1 and Circuits.GPIO.write/2 to control the LED.

Starting this module in your application's supervision tree (in `lib/my_iot_app/application.ex`).

Interacting with the running application:
After booting, you can connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH and access an interactive Elixir shell (IEx) 
to inspect and interact with your running Nerves application.
