# nerves iot app running on raspberry pi sample

Nerves is an embedded Elixir platform for building IoT applications on devices like the Raspberry Pi. 
To create a sample Nerves IoT application running on a Raspberry Pi, one can follow these general steps:

Set up the Nerves development environment:

Install Elixir and Erlang.
Install nerves_bootstrap using mix archive.install hex nerves_bootstrap.

Create a new Nerves project:

Use `mix nerves.new my_iot_app` to create a new project directory.

Navigate into the new project directory: `cd my_iot_app`.

Configure the target hardware:

Set the MIX_TARGET environment variable to match your Raspberry Pi model (e.g., export MIX_TARGET=rpi3 for a Raspberry Pi 3). 
This tells Nerves which system image to build.

Add dependencies and application logic:

Edit the mix.exs file to add necessary dependencies, such as circuits_gpio for GPIO control if you're interacting with hardware.

Implement your application logic in Elixir modules within the lib directory. For example, 
a simple "Blinky" application might use Circuits.GPIO to toggle an LED connected to a specific GPIO pin.

Build the firmware:
Run mix firmware to compile your application and build the Nerves firmware image for your specified target.

Burn the firmware to an SD card:

Use mix firmware.burn to write the generated firmware image to an SD card. This command will prompt you to select the correct SD card device.

Boot the Raspberry Pi:
Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and power it on. The Nerves application should boot and run.

Example (Blinky application):

A common starting point is the "Blinky" example, which demonstrates basic hardware interaction. This involves:

Adding {:circuits_gpio, "~> 2.0"} to your deps in mix.exs.

Creating a GenServer or simple module to manage the LED state, using Circuits.GPIO.open/1 and Circuits.GPIO.write/2 to control the LED.

Starting this module in your application's supervision tree (in `lib/my_iot_app/application.ex`).

Interacting with the running application:
After booting, you can connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH and access an interactive Elixir shell (IEx) 
to inspect and interact with your running Nerves application.
