To use the Chisel Diplomacy feature for a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) chip design, you need to define nodes and parameters that represent the SNN's structure and connections. Then, use Diplomacy's framework to manage these nodes for parameter exchange and interface generation between different modules (like neurons and synapses). This involves instantiating `SourceNode`, `SinkNode`, or `NexusNode`, and defining Edge parameters to communicate the necessary information between SNN components during the hardware elaboration process.

Here's a more detailed approach:

1.  **Understand Diplomacy's Role**
    *   **Parameterization:** Chisel's Diplomacy is a system for managing the configuration and interconnection of hardware modules. In an SNN chip, this means defining how the parameters of neurons and synapses (like synaptic weights, neuron thresholds, etc.) are passed and adjusted between different parts of the chip.
    *   **Abstraction:** Diplomacy abstracts away low-level hardware connections, allowing you to define complex interactions through a higher-level interface.

2.  **Define SNN Modules with Diplomacy Nodes**
    *   **Neuron and Synapse Modules:** Create Chisel modules for your SNN's neurons and synapses. These modules will have ports for data and control.
    *   **Instantiate Nodes:** Inside these modules, define Diplomacy nodes to manage their interfaces:
        *   `SourceNode`: For modules that initiate connections and provide parameters (e.g., a master neuron sending its spike to other neurons).
        *   `SinkNode`: For modules that receive parameters or data (e.g., a slave synapse receiving spikes).
        *   `NexusNode`: For complex interconnects that connect multiple master and slave nodes simultaneously.

3.  **Define Diplomacy Edge Parameters**
    *   **Parameter Bundle:** Create an `EdgeParam` type (or a `Bundle`) to describe the parameters that need to be exchanged between your SNN components. This could include:
        *   Synaptic weights and delays
        *   Neuron membrane potential thresholds
        *   Learning rate parameters for synaptic plasticity (like STDP)
    *   **Parameter Negotiation:** The Diplomacy framework uses these edge parameters to negotiate the exact details of the connections between different modules.

4.  **Connect Modules using Diplomacy**
    *   **`inward` and `outward`:** Use `inward` and `outward` calls on your Nodes to connect different modules, ensuring that the correct parameters are passed and the hardware interfaces are properly generated.
    *   **Elaboration:** During Chisel's elaboration phase, the Diplomacy system will take these defined nodes and parameters and construct the underlying hardware graph, generating the necessary interconnections and parameter values for your SNN chip.

### Example Scenario for an SNN

Imagine connecting a "Neuron" module to a "Synapse" module:

*   The "Neuron" module would have a `SourceNode` to send its output spike.
*   The "Synapse" module would have a `SinkNode` to receive this spike.
*   An `EdgeParam` might define the synaptic weight.
*   Diplomacy handles the connection, ensuring the synaptic weight from the `EdgeParam` is associated with the connection from the Neuron to the Synapse, and the spike is routed correctly.
